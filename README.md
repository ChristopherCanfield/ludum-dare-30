ludum-dare-30
=============

A work-in-progress game that is slowly being worked on. This was initially created during the jam component of Ludum Dare 30, which had "Connected Worlds" as the theme. The team was comprised of six people with a wide range of skills:

- A software engineer
- A research psychologist
- A nurse
- A city planner & lawyer
- A musician
- A farmhand, candle-maker and cook

We weren't successful with completing the game during the jam - our scope was too large, and the art needs were probably underestimated - but we had quite a bit of fun anyway.
